    "info": "The Happiness Score Questionnaire, a 50-question tool, quantifies happiness and well-being in areas like personal satisfaction, health, work satisfaction, and spirituality. The happiness score is an average of all responses, with higher scores indicating greater happiness. A demographic section provides context for deeper data analysis but doesn't influence the score. This questionnaire aims to guide AI chatbot development, helping users boost their scores and achieve greater happiness. It also lays groundwork for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) or Superintelligent AI (SGI) to offer personalized solutions, with the ultimate goal of improving individuals' happiness using AI.",
